#Notes on sorting algorithms

#### Bubble Sort

1. compare first item with the second, if bigger swap them - so bigger one is in 2nd position (or index 1, not 0).
2. compare second with the third, if bigger swap else leave.
3. continue doing this for the entire array.

#### Selection Sort

1. iterate through the array swap the lowest element with the element at index 0
2. iterate throught the array bar index 0 and swap the lowest element index 1
3. continue the above until you reach the last element in the array.
